AI-Powered Financial Agent for India Using Model Context Protocol
Project Overview
Create a sophisticated AI-powered financial agent tailored for the Indian market that leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture. The system will monitor real-time financial data and news, perform sentiment analysis, and generate investment strategies based on market conditions specific to Indian financial markets.

Core Requirements

MCP Integration: Build on the MCP server architecture to create a robust context-aware system that can store, retrieve, and reason with financial data and strategies.
Sentiment Analysis: Implement comprehensive sentiment analysis of financial news, social media, and market reports focusing on Indian markets.
Learning System: Develop a mechanism to track strategy performance, learn from outcomes, and continuously improve recommendation quality.
India-Specific Adaptation: Ensure the system understands Indian market regulations, trading hours, cultural factors affecting markets, and local financial instruments.
Strategy Repository: Create an evolving database of trading strategies mapped to specific market conditions and news sentiment patterns.

MCP-Specific Implementation

MCP Context Management: Utilize MCP servers for storing and retrieving financial strategies, market patterns, and decision histories.
Knowledge Base Construction: Build a context-aware knowledge base using MCP's context management capabilities.
MCP Agent Structure: Follow the pattern established in the pydantic-ai-mcp-agent repository, adapting it for financial analysis.
Server Configuration: Implement the server architecture using specialized MCP servers (detailed below).
Quant Integration: Integrate quantitative analysis libraries with MCP for advanced financial modeling.

Recommended MCP Servers

Vectorize MCP Server: Primary storage for trading strategies with advanced retrieval capabilities, private deep research, document extraction, and text chunking for financial news analysis.
Qdrant Integration: Implement semantic memory layer on top of the Qdrant vector search engine for similarity-based strategy retrieval.
SQL Server: Use a relational database for structured financial data, performance metrics, and transaction logging.

Technical Architecture
Use a microservices approach with these core components:

MCP Server Layer: Central backbone for context management and reasoning
Data Ingestion Service: Real-time processing of market data and news from Indian sources
Analysis Engine: Sentiment analysis and market condition classification
Strategy Mapping System: Connect market conditions to appropriate strategies
Performance Tracking: Monitor and evaluate strategy outcomes
User Interface: Clean, intuitive dashboard for strategy recommendations

Data Sources to Integrate

NSE and BSE real-time market data
RBI announcements and monetary policy updates
Major Indian financial news outlets
Indian business social media sentiment
Historical performance of various sectors in the Indian market

Learning Mechanism
The system should:

Track the performance of each recommended strategy
Identify patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful recommendations
Adjust future recommendations based on historical performance
Incorporate feedback from users about strategy effectiveness
Store successful strategies in MCP servers for future retrieval
Progressively refine its understanding of Indian market dynamics

Strategy Storage with MCP

Use Vectorize MCP Server for persistent storage of successful trading strategies with advanced retrieval capabilities
Implement Qdrant as a semantic memory layer for context-based retrieval to match current market conditions with historical strategies
Store structured financial data in SQL Server for performance tracking and analysis
Implement a tagging system for strategies based on market conditions, sentiment analysis results, and performance metrics
Leverage Vectorize's text chunking capabilities to process financial news and blogs by great traders
Use Vectorize's Anything-to-Markdown extraction for processing various document formats containing trading wisdom
Develop a version control system for strategies as they evolve and improve
Build an evaluation mechanism to continuously assess stored strategies against new market data
